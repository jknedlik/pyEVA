This directory contains an example that may be directly used 
as the basis for your own optimization problems. In order to 
adapt the example to your needs, it is recommended to start
from the GStarterIndividual-code in this directory.

Note that this example is not the best starting point if you
are new to Geneva. In this case we recommend to check the
preceding examples first and particularly to read the manual.

The GStarter-example is in contrast targeted at situations, where
already serious optimization problems should be tackled. It 
therefore contains already some advanced code, such as an 
optimization monitor (optional, it is needed if you want to find
out more about the inner workings of your individuals and/or 
Geneva).

It should also be possible to extract the entire directory from
the Geneva distribution and adapt the build system to your needs
with relative ease. The CMakeLists.txt (i.e. the main steering
file of the build for this example) has been written in such
a way that it should also work autonomously.

It should be possible to first copy the example out of the source
tree and then compile it seperately. E.g.:

$ cd ~
$ mkdir GStarterExample
$ cd GStarterExample
$ cp -R /where/Geneva/is/examples/geneva/10_GStarterIndividual/* .
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DGENEVA_ROOT="/opt/geneva" -DBOOST_ROOT="/opt/boost154" ..

Note that, depending on whether you built Geneva with or without
testing support, you will need to supply the flag -DGENEVA_BUILD_TESTS=true

It is a precondition that you have compiled and installed Geneva
before following this procedure.
